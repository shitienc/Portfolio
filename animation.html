            <h4>About:</h4>

            <p>At Zealand, I worked on a project called: SoMe & Branding. Its focus was to get a better understanding of
                social media, content
                creation and communication. Our group had to create SoMe content for our previous project: "Call Me
                Handy" , which lead to my
                animated GIF's.
            </p>

        <div class="text">
            <h4>My role:</h4>

            <p>In this project, my role included several different tasks. Although my main task was to create SoMe content and coding a page for
                the website. Moreover, I participated in the development processes, such as the target group analysis
                and project writing process.

            <h4>The solution:</h4>

            <p>To finish the main task of creating SoMe content, I designed two posts based on the research we had
                gathered and our target group
                analysis. After designing the content in Adobe Illustrator, I chose to make the illustration more lively
                by adding some effects in Adobe
                After Effects.
