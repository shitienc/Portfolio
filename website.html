        <div class="text">
            <h4>About:</h4>

            <p>In my current study at Zealand, I participated in a project
                called: Startup Mission, its aim is based on these categories:
                Greentech, Social Entrepreneurship, LifeTech or Service
                innovation. Our group developed an idea based on Service
                innovation, which brought us to Call Me Handy.

                Call Me Handy is an app for people who need help in regards
                to various small craft tasks and gardening. They can seek
                help from experienced people for a smaller price. Since this
                kind of a product already exists on the market, we chose to
                optimize our product by including more safety features,
                which would give us to a stronger position in the market.

            <h4>My role:</h4>

            <p>In this project, I was responsable for creating a website
                for our app and company. It was a demand to create
                the website from the bottom by using HTML and CSS.

        <div class="text">
            <h4>The solution:</h4>

            <p>My solution for the assignment, was to create an user
                friendly website, where all the necessary information
                could be found. I started the process by doing some
                wireframes and mock ups. This lead to an easy process
                when I started coding on the website, by using Visual
                Studio Code.

        <h3>Hotel Alien - Rumrejsen</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <h4>About:</h4>

            <p>
                "Rumrejsen" was my first project at Zealand, which was about developing a concept for a fictional space
                travel program.
                In addition, we had to create a website using HTML and CSS for the chosen concept. After going through a
                lot of brainstorming,
                our group decided to develop the concept: Hotel Alien.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <h4>My role:</h4>

            <p>My role throughout this project was mainly to code the page "Packages & Offers". Moreover, I participated
                in the development
                processes, such as the concept-, target group analysis-, and project writing process.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <h4>The solution:</h4>

            <p>The overall project resulted in the creation of a user friendly website for our target audience. Thus,
                users can easily navigate
                around the website and obtain the needed information. The website was established by understanding the
                concept and the target
                group, which was done throughout our processes.

        <h3>Den Kinesiske Butik - Business Development</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <h4>About:</h4>

            <p>In my previous study AP Degree - Service, Hospitality and Tourism Management at Cphbusiness, I worked on
                a project called "Business Development". The main focus of this
                project was to collaborate with an existed company, in which we had to problem solve or optimize an
                issue with the company.
                Our group decided to do a collaboration with a retail store called "Den Kinesiske Butik", which sold
                Chinese and other Asian products.
                After much internal and external research and analysis of the company, we learned that the company was
                in need for an optimized
                and updated website, thus we created a new modern and user-friendly website for Den Kinesiske Butik
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <h4>My role:</h4>

            <p>For this project, my main assignment was to design and establish the new website by using the platform
                WIX. In addition, I was part
                of the project planning, analysis process and overall problem solution.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <h4>The solution:</h4>

            <p>We created a website which users could easily navigate to find needed information about the store and
                their products, moreover
                which products they could buy in the stores webshop. We learned that the target audience were middle age
                and elderly regular
                costumers. Thus, the website had to be useful and helpful for this target demographic. The optimized
                website was also created
                to be appealing to new younger costumers who desire Asian goods.
