            <h4>About:</h4>
        
            <p>In my current study at Zealand, I participated in a project
                called: Startup Mission, its  aim is based on these categories:
                Greentech, Social Entrepreneurship,  LifeTech or Service 
                innovation. Our group developed an idea based on Service 
                innovation, which brought us to Call Me Handy. 
                
                Call Me Handy is an app for people who need help in regards
                to various small craft tasks and gardening. They can seek 
                help from experienced people for a smaller price. Since this 
                kind of a product already exists on the market, we chose to
                optimize our product by including more safety features,
                which would give us to a stronger position in the market.

            <h4>My role:</h4>
        
            <p>In this project, I was responsable for creating a website
                for our app and company. It was a demand to create
                the website from the bottom by using HTML and CSS

            <h4>The solution:</h4>
        
            <p>My solution for the assignment, was to create an user 
                friendly website, where all the necessary information 
                could be found. I started the process by doing some
                wireframes and mock ups. This lead to an easy process
                when I started coding on the website, by using Visual
                Studio Code.
